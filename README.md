A web app for real estate (OSTL Mini Project)

### Abstract

A Django based web app for connecting property sellers/renters and prospective buyers. Buyers can see the list of properties available for buying or renting without signing up. Search can also be made by applying a few filters and adding some keywords. But to view the contact information of the sellers, user has to sign up using a few basic personal details. An e-mail verification system is set up to validate the user’s information while registering.

Once a user account is created, the user can check detailed information about the property like area, facilities nearby etc., and also get contact information of the sellers. Users can also put up properties for sale/rent by posting information about their properties (including images). Admin has the sole right of verifying a property, thus giving added credibility to the information posted. User can get information about all their properties registered on the website from the dashboard.
Users can post their feedback of the website. They can also directly contact the administrators by mailing their queries.
